This is the secure version which has the correct solution.

In this solution we employ the technique of input validation to filter out the dubious inputs which may contain an SQL Injection. 

In this particular code we do this by making a regular expression match with letters. Since a name can only contain letters we match for letters only. If it fails we do not run the code at all.
