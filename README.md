# SQL-Injection-
This is sample code showing basic SQL injection and solutions to it.

There are three branches currently. 

The first vulnerable code branch is the branch with normal code which is prone to attacks like SQL injection.

The next branch is the master branch which has the secure code with proper solution.

The last branch is the one with an incorrect solution to the problem of SQL injection.
